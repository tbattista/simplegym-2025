# 🚀 Ghost Gym - Railway Deployment Guide

## Overview
This guide covers the complete deployment process for the Ghost Gym Log Book application on Railway, a modern cloud platform that natively supports FastAPI and ASGI applications.

---

## 🌟 Why Railway?

Railway is the perfect platform for FastAPI applications because it:
- **Native ASGI Support** - No WSGI wrappers or compromises needed
- **Automatic HTTPS** - Built-in SSL certificates for all deployments
- **Git-based Deployments** - Automatic deployments from your repository
- **Environment Variables** - Secure configuration management
- **Real-time Logs** - Comprehensive application monitoring
- **Scalable Infrastructure** - Easy scaling as your app grows
- **Developer-Friendly** - Simple setup with powerful features

---

## 📋 Prerequisites

- Railway account (free tier available)
- Git repository with your code
- GitHub/GitLab account (for automatic deployments)

---

## 🛠️ Railway Setup

### 1. Create Railway Account
1. Go to [railway.app](https://railway.app)
2. Sign up with GitHub/GitLab (recommended for easy deployments)
3. Verify your account

### 2. Create New Project
1. Click **"New Project"**
2. Select **"Deploy from GitHub repo"**
3. Choose your `simplegym-2025` repository
4. Railway will automatically detect it's a Python project

### 3. Automatic Configuration
Railway will automatically:
- Detect Python and install dependencies from `requirements.txt`
- Use the `Procfile` to start your FastAPI application
- Configure the web service with proper port binding
- Set up health checks using `/api/health` endpoint

---

## ⚙️ Configuration Files

Your project includes these Railway-optimized files:

### `Procfile`
```
web: uvicorn backend.main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port $PORT
```
This tells Railway how to start your FastAPI application.

### `railway.toml`
```toml
[build]
builder = "NIXPACKS"

[deploy]
healthcheckPath = "/api/health"
healthcheckTimeout = 300
restartPolicyType = "ON_FAILURE"
restartPolicyMaxRetries = 10

[environments.production]
variables = { }
```
This configures Railway's deployment settings and health checks.

---

## 🌐 Domain Setup

### Automatic Railway Domain
Railway automatically provides a domain like:
- `your-app-name-production.up.railway.app`

### Custom Domain (Optional)
1. Go to your project settings
2. Click **"Domains"**
3. Add your custom domain
4. Update your DNS records as instructed
5. Railway automatically handles SSL certificates

---

## 🔧 Environment Variables

### Required Variables
Railway automatically sets:
- `PORT` - The port your app should listen on
- `RAILWAY_ENVIRONMENT` - Current environment (production/staging)

### Optional Variables (if needed)
You can add custom environment variables in Railway dashboard:
1. Go to your service
2. Click **"Variables"**
3. Add any custom variables your app needs

---

## 📊 Monitoring and Logs

### Real-time Logs
1. Go to your Railway project
2. Click on your service
3. View **"Logs"** tab for real-time application logs
4. Filter by log level (info, error, debug)

### Metrics
Railway provides built-in metrics:
- CPU usage
- Memory usage
- Network traffic
- Response times

### Health Checks
Your app includes a health check endpoint at `/api/health` that Railway monitors automatically.

---

## 🚀 Deployment Process

### Automatic Deployments
1. Push changes to your main branch
2. Railway automatically detects changes
3. Builds and deploys your application
4. Zero-downtime deployment

### Manual Deployment
1. Go to Railway dashboard
2. Click **"Deploy"** on your service
3. Railway rebuilds and redeploys

---

## ✅ Verification Checklist

After deployment, verify:

- [ ] Website loads at your Railway URL
- [ ] API documentation available at `/docs`
- [ ] Health check responds at `/api/health`
- [ ] Template dropdown populates
- [ ] Document generation works
- [ ] PDF preview functionality works
- [ ] Static files (CSS/JS) load properly
- [ ] Mobile responsive design works
- [ ] HTTPS is automatically enabled

---

## 🎯 Full FastAPI Functionality Restored

### ✅ What Now Works (vs PythonAnywhere):
- **🔥 `/docs` Endpoint** - Interactive API documentation

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues and Solutions

#### 1. Build Failures
**Symptoms**: Deployment fails during build

**Solutions**:
- Check `requirements.txt` for invalid dependencies
- Ensure Python version compatibility
- Check Railway build logs for specific errors

#### 2. Application Won't Start
**Symptoms**: Build succeeds but app doesn't respond

**Solutions**:
- Verify `Procfile` is correct
- Check that app binds to `0.0.0.0:$PORT`
- Review application logs in Railway dashboard

#### 3. Static Files Not Loading
**Symptoms**: CSS/JS files return 404

**Solutions**:
- Ensure `frontend/` directory is in repository
- Check FastAPI static file mounting in `main.py`
- Verify file paths are correct

#### 4. PDF Generation Issues
**Symptoms**: PDF preview fails

**Solutions**:
- Check if `docx2pdf` dependencies are available
- Review error logs for specific issues
- Ensure Word documents are valid

### Debug Commands
```bash
# Test locally before deploying
python run.py

# Check if all endpoints work
curl http://localhost:8000/api/health
curl http://localhost:8000/api/templates

# Test document generation
# (Use the web interface or API docs at /docs)
```
